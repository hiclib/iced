New features
------------

  - Added a new filtering option `remove_all_zeros_loci` which removes
    non-interacting rows and columns from the count matrix *prior* to applying
    the filtering strategy.
    By Nicolas Servant and Nelle Varoquaux 

  - `ice` now has a new option `--output-bias`. If provided, the bias vector
    will be saved in a file in addition of the normalized contact counts.
