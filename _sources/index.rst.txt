Iced
================================


Recent technological advances allow the measurement, in a single Hi-C
experiment, of the frequencies of physical contacts among pairs of genomic
loci at a genome-wide scale.

**Iced** implements a fast and memory efficient of the ICE normalization
strategy. It is included in the HiC-pro pipeline, that processes data from raw
fastq files to normalized contact maps. ``iced`` grew bigger than just
being a normalization packages, and contains a number of utilities functions
that may be useful if you are analyzing and processing Hi-C data.
