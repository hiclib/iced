   The code-examples in the above tutorials are written in a
   *python-console* format. If you wish to easily execute these examples
   in **IPython**, use::

  %doctest_mode

   in the IPython-console. You can then simply copy and paste the examples
   directly into IPython without having to worry about removing the **>>>**
   manually.


What is iced?
=============

``iced`` is a python package that contains normalization techniques for Hi-C data.
It is included in the HiC-pro pipeline, that processes data from raw fastq
files to normalized contact maps. Eventually, ``iced`` grew bigger than just being a
normalization packages, and contains a number of utilities functions that may
be useful if you are analyzing and processing Hi-C data.

Working with Hi-C data in Python
================================

Hi-C data boils down to a matrix of contact counts. Each row and columns
corresponds to a genomic window, and each entry to the number of times these
genomic windows have been observed to interact with one another. Python
happens to be an excellent language to manipulate matrices, and ``iced``
leverages a number of scientific packages that provides nice and easy-to-use
matrix operation.

Loading an example dataset
==========================

``iced`` comes with a sample data set that allows you to play a bit with the
package. The sample data set included corresponds to the first 5 chromosomes
of the budding yeast *S. cerevisiae*. In the following, we start a Python or
IPython interpreter from our shell and load this data set. Our notational
convention is that ``$`` denotes the shell prompt while ``>>>`` denotes the
Python interpreter prompt::                                                                                      

  $ python
  >>> from iced import datasets
  >>> counts, lengths = datasets.load_sample_yeast()

A data set in ``iced`` is composed of an N by N numpy.ndarray ``counts`` and a
vector of ``lengths`` that contains the number of bins per chromosomes. For
our sample data, the vector ``lengths`` is an ndarray of length 5, underlying
we have here 5 chromosomes::

  >>> print(len(lengths))
  5

The contact map ``counts`` should be squared and symmetric. The shape should
also match the lengths vector::

  >>> print(counts.shape)
  (350, 350)
  >>> print(lengths.sum())
  350

The ``counts`` matrix is here of size 350 by 350.

Normalizing a data set with ICE
===============================

Now that we have some data loaded, let's proceed to normalizing it. There are
two normalization algorithms implemented in `iced`: ICE and SCN. ICE is the
most widely used normalization technique on Hi-C data, so this is the one we
will showcase.

ICE is based on a matrix balancing algorithm. The underlying assumptions are
that the contact map suffers from biases that can be decomposable as a product
of regionale biases: :math:`C_{ij} = \beta_i \beta_j N_{ij}`, where
:math:`C_{ij}` is the raw contact counts between loci :math:`i` and :math:`j`,
:math:`N_{ij}` the normalized contact counts, and :math:`\beta` the bias
vector.

Normalizing the data is as simple as follows ::

  >>> from iced import normalization
  >>> normed = normalization.ICE_normalization(counts)

But the estimation of the bias vector can be severely problematic in low
coverage regions. In fact, if the matrix is too sparse, the algorithm may not
converge at all! To avoid this, Imakaev et al recommend filtering out a
certain percentage of rows and columns that interact the least. This has to
be performed prior to applying the normalization algorithm::
  
  >>> from iced import filter
  >>> counts = filter.filter_low_counts(counts, percentage=0.04)
  >>> normed = normalization.ICE_normalization(counts)

How about cancer data sets? LOIC and CAIC
=========================================

The last section discusses normalizing Hi-C data using ICE. This method is not
adapted to normalize cancer data sets: several of the assumptions made do not
hold in the presence of copy number variation.

``iced`` proposes two methods for normalizing data sets with copy number
variations:

- ``LOIC``, to preserve enrichment in interactions due to copy number
  variations
- ``CAIC`` to remove copy number variation effects in the contact count matrix.

Two examples are available in the gallery, showcasing how to use ``LOIC``
and ``CAIC`` with ``ice``.
